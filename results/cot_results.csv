Final Answer: [just the answer, no explanation]","Reasoning:

1. The question is asking for the perimeter of a rectangle.
2. To find the perimeter of a rectangle, we need to add up the lengths of all its sides.
3. A rectangle has two pairs of opposite sides with equal length. Let's denote one pair as ""l"" and the other pair as ""w"". In this case, l = 12 cm and w = 8 cm.
4. The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is: P = 2(l + w).
5. Now we can plug in the values for length and width into the formula: P = 2(12 + 8).

3. Work through each part carefully:
   - Since R implies not-Q, when we say R is true, it must be the case that not-Q is also true (by the definition of implication).

1. The question is asking for the output of the given Python code.
2. Break down the problem into smaller parts:
   - Evaluate the value of x (5).
   - Evaluate the value of y (3).
   - Compare the values of x and y using the > operator.
   - Print the result of the comparison.
3. Work through each part carefully:
   - The value of x is 5, which is greater than 3 (the value of y).
   - So, x > y will evaluate to True.

1. The question is asking for the output of a Python code snippet that compares two numbers.
2. Break down the problem into smaller parts:
   - Evaluate x = 5
   - Evaluate y = 3
   - Compare the values of x and y using the print statement
3. Work through each part carefully:
   - Assign x = 5 (done)
   - Assign y = 3 (done)
   - The comparison operator > will evaluate to True if x is greater than y, so it will compare 5 with 3

1. The question is asking for the output of the given code snippet.
2. We are given two lists: x = [1,2,3] and y = x.
3. Since y = x, both variables now point to the same list object in memory.
4. When we append a new element (4) to y, it modifies the original list object that both x and y reference.
5. Therefore, when we print x, it will also print [1,2,3,4] because they are referencing the same list.
