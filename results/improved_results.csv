Respond with only the numerical answer.","Let x be the total capacity of the tank.

Since the tank was initially 1/3 full, it contained (1/3)x liters of liquid.

When 40 liters were added, it became 2/3 full, so it now contains (2/3)x liters of liquid.

We can set up an equation based on this information:

(1/3)x + 40 = (2/3)x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fractions:

x + 120 = 2x

Subtracting x from both sides gives us:

120 = x

So, the total capacity of the tank is 120 liters.",120,1,1.0,4787.1091999986675,True

32,math,3,2,"Question: Three pipes can fill a tank in 6, 8, and 12 hours respectively. How long to fill the tank if all three pipes are open?

Respond with only the numerical answer.","The question is incomplete without knowing the total capacity of the tank or how much of it each pipe can fill per hour.

However, we can calculate the rate at which each pipe fills the tank and then add those rates together to find the combined rate:

Pipe 1: 1/6 of the tank per hour
Pipe 2: 1/8 of the tank per hour
Pipe 3: 1/12 of the tank per hour

Combined rate: 1/6 + 1/8 + 1/12 = 4/24 + 3/24 + 2/24 = 9/24 = 3/8 of the tank per hour.
