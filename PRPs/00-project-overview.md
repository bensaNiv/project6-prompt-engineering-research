# Project Overview: Prompt Engineering Research

## Objective
Measure how different prompt techniques affect LLM performance at scale (mass production context).

## Stages

| Stage | PRP File | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | `01-stage-1-dataset.md` | Create 100 test cases dataset |
| 2 | `02-stage-2-baseline.md` | Run baseline prompts, collect metrics |
| 3 | `03-stage-3-techniques.md` | Test 4 prompt improvement techniques |
| 4 | `04-stage-4-analysis.md` | Generate visualizations and final report |

## Execution Order
Run stages sequentially: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4

Each stage depends on the previous stage's deliverables.

## Technical Details
All implementation details are in `docs/` folder. PRPs provide workflow guidance only.
